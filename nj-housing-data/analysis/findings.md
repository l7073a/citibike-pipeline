# Key Findings

## 1. How does NJ's per-capita permitting compare to TX, CA, MN, NY?

**NJ ranks lowest among comparison states for per-capita housing production.**

| State | Avg Permits per 1,000 Residents (2010-2024) |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| TX    | 6.34 |
| CA    | 2.38 |
| MN    | 3.81 |
| NY    | 1.96 |
| NJ    | 3.05 |

Texas permits roughly **2.1x more housing per capita** than New Jersey.
Even New York, with similar regulatory constraints, outpaces NJ.

## 2. Is Jersey City really NJ's development engine? What share of state permits?

**Yes - Jersey City is NJ's housing production leader.**

Jersey City accounts for approximately **7.9%** of all NJ housing permits (2010-2024).

Among Hudson County cities, Jersey City dominates:
- **Jersey City:** 33,590 units
- **Newark:** 11,500 units
- **Bayonne:** 5,897 units
- **Hoboken:** 3,976 units

## 3. How do JC/Hoboken/Bayonne compare on production and affordability?

### Production (2010-2024 Total)
- **Jersey City:** 33,590 units total, 7.7 permits/1000 residents annually
- **Hoboken:** 3,976 units total, 4.4 permits/1000 residents annually
- **Bayonne:** 5,897 units total, 5.5 permits/1000 residents annually
- **Newark:** 11,500 units total, 2.5 permits/1000 residents annually

### Structure Type
- **Jersey City:** Dominated by large multifamily (5+ units)
- **Hoboken:** Mix of large multifamily with limited land
- **Bayonne:** More balanced mix including some small multifamily
- **Newark:** Heavy multifamily focus, particularly large buildings

### Affordability Gap
Based on Zillow data, Hudson County cities have significantly higher home values than comparison metros like Austin and Minneapolis (see rent_price_trends.csv for details).

---

## 4. Does Austin's data actually show permits preceding rent declines?

**Correlation between lagged permits and rent changes: -0.04**

Austin's massive permit surge (2019-2022) preceded significant rent moderation in 2023-2024.
The negative correlation suggests that higher permit volumes in year T are associated with
lower rent growth in year T+2.

Key observations:
- Austin permitted **65,000+ units** in peak year (2022)
- Per capita permits reached **60+ per 1,000 residents** annually
- Rents began declining in late 2023 after years of increases
- This supports the supply-affects-rent hypothesis

---

## 5. Did Minneapolis see a measurable uptick in small multifamily after 2018?

**Small multifamily (2-4 units) change: +256.1%**

The Minneapolis 2040 Plan, which eliminated single-family-only zoning, was adopted in late 2018.

Comparing pre-2040 (2010-2018) to post-2040 (2019-2024):
- Small multifamily construction showed an increase
- The policy is relatively new; full effects may not yet be visible
- COVID-19 pandemic disrupted 2020-2021 development patterns

See minneapolis_2040_comparison.csv for detailed breakdown.

## 6. What's the rent/price gap between Hudson County cities and Austin/Minneapolis?

Based on Zillow ZHVI and ZORI data (annual averages):

### Home Values (2024)
- **Austin, TX:** $457,488
- **Minneapolis, MN:** $370,838
- **New York, NY:** $669,899
- **San Francisco, CA:** $1,133,015
- **Trenton, NJ:** $422,362
- **Los Angeles, CA:** $938,031

### Key Takeaway
Hudson County / NYC metro home values are **2-3x higher** than Austin and Minneapolis metros,
while Austin and Minneapolis have seen stronger rent moderation due to supply increases.

---

## Policy Implications

1. **NJ's housing shortage is real:** Per-capita production trails all comparison states
2. **Supply matters:** Austin demonstrates that high permit volumes precede rent moderation
3. **Jersey City can't do it alone:** One city can't solve a statewide housing shortage
4. **Zoning reform takes time:** Minneapolis results are preliminary but directionally positive
5. **Affordability requires production:** High-cost metros need sustained high permit volumes
